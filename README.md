# F4Epurity

## Description

F4Epurity is a python-based tool that can be used to approximate the change in activity and dose resulting from a deviation in chemical composition of a material under irradiation. 

The tool works for a point or line deviation and outputs a 3D map of the deviation in dose in *vtr* format. This dose field assumes unshielded and unscattered conditions.  

Instruction on installation and usage of the tool can be found at [INSERT LINK]
