F4Epurity is a python-based tool that can be used to approximate the change in activity and dose resulting from a deviation in chemical composition of a material under irradiation.

The tool works for a point or line deviation and outputs a 3D map of the deviation in dose in vtr format. This dose field assumes unshielded and unscattered conditions.
