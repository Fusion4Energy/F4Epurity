Usage
#####

Once installed, the tool is straightforward to use. The main tool can be run in the command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    f4epurity -h

This will show the help menu in the command line, which details the required and optional arguments for the tool.

It is also possible to plot global maps of the collapsed cross section and the activity. These tools can be run with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    f4epurity-xs -h

.. code-block:: bash

    f4epurity-activity -h

All of the output files from running the tool are placed into a timestamped output folder. The folder will contain a *metadata.json* file, which logs the input commands that were run.
