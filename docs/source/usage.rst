## Usage

Once installed, the tool is straightforward to use. The main tool can be ran in the command line.

```bash
f4epurity -h
```

This will show help menu in the command line which details the required and optional arguments for the tool. 

It is also possible to plot global maps of the collapsed cross section and the activity. These tools can be ran with the following commands.

```bash
f4epurity-xs -h
```
```bash
f4epurity-activity -h
```
All of the output files from running the tool are placed into a timestamped output folder. The folder will contain a *metadata.json* file which logs the input commands that were run.
